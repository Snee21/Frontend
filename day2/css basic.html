    <p>It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you 
        with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. 
        You want to look, but you don't at the same time. 
        You're frozen with fear and unable to act. 
        That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next</p>
